# git-push
Handy utility to check-in code.  One click to update gitHub repository within a given project.
I always forget what the steps are thus the script
The script is Windows based. It supports comments when checking in the code.
Steps:
Copy git-pish.bat into your gitHub project folder.
After development when ready to check-in the code type in the porject's folder:

</I> git-push  my first checkin in sample with comments </>



You are done!!!
Enjoy
