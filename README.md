# git-push
Handy utility to check-in the code.  One click to update gitHub repository within a given project.
<br>I always forget what the steps are thus the script...
<br>
The script is Windows compatible and it supports comments when checking in the code.
<br><br>
Steps:
Copy <b>git-push.bat</b> script into your project folder.
<br>When you are ready to check-in the code type in the porject's folder the following command (alternatively  you can create a shrtcut):
<br>
<br>
<h1>
<b>git-push</b> <I> my first check-in in sample with comments </I>
<br>
</h1>
<br>
You are done!!!
Enjoy
